RE: Our English Garden Tour, July 2 to 8, 2000</b><br>
Full payment required by April 17th</font> <p>
<font face="Times New Roman">
Greetings for the New Millennium! You are cordially invited to an English
Garden Tour custom designed by me. I will be the horticultural tour
guide. After I visited England's gardens in the early 1990's I wanted
our clients and friends to experience them and see firsthand century-old
gardens. I talk about them to almost everyone with garden interests
including at a San Francisco Strybring Arboretum seminar I gave
in Golden Gate Park.&nbsp; At last the opportunity has
come forth. One of our clients, who has taken many tours
to England, wants me to conduct an English garden tour for
her, her daughter, and our clients. She is helping with the tour's logistics.
The idea came about at our Twentieth Anniversary Party last October
when she observed the sharing and new friendships that took place.&nbsp; I have selected what I consider the best gardens in England, all
of which I've previously visited. In a small group of
about twenty people we will walk the gardens together and
talk about their greatness in an historical and
contemporary context as well as discuss the design, plants
and details applicable to your garden. Sissinghurst, Hildcote Manor,
Barnsley House, Great Dixter and Stourhead have books written solely
about their creation and are pictured in most every book on English
gardens. We have selected small quaint hotels near these rural gardens
to give you a feel of the nearby country towns and to give you an
intimate atmosphere to become acquainted with those on the Tour. I have
already received a letter from the owner of Barnsley House, Rosemary Verey, welcoming me back and offering us a
special guided tour.
Hampton Court has a wonderful garden and its Flower Show is the second
biggest garden event in England. We will be fortunate to see this as
well. See the attached itinerary for details.&nbsp; I've
never seen such a reasonably priced garden tour (land costs $1855.00
double occupancy) with no waste of time visiting second class gardens.
Call us if you have any questions or want further information and
detailed tour conditions. We see this as a wonderful opportunity to inspire
a new garden or to continue improving on your garden in imaginative
and tasteful settings. On the trip I want to hear about your garden's
successes and failures and help you get through any problems you
might be having. We should have a lot to learn from each other. The tour
is at a time which will allow you also to visit several internationally
famous British events - the Wimbledon Tennis Championships,
the Ascot Horse Races , and the Henley Royal Regatta Boats
Races.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">I wish you and your family good health, wise choices, prosperity and
happiness
in the next century.</font></p>

<p><b><u><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">A Custom Designed Itinerary to England’s Finest
Gardens and the Hampton Court Flower Show</font></u></b></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><b>Note:</b> Please be aware that European traditional hotels (such as those included in this itinerary) do not compare to American modern hotels in
similar categories, and can sometimes mean smaller rooms, uneven floors, etc..</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><b>July 2, Sunday: LONDON HEATHROW/STOW ON THE
WOLD.</b>&nbsp;<br>
 Upon individual arrival at London Heathrow guests will make their way to the Hilton
Hotel (in the airport) and gather in the lobby no later than 1.00 PM for departure. Meet your tour escort (specialized in horticulture) and your
driver, and travel west into the Cotswolds and the lovely village of Stow on the
Wold. Here guests will be checked into the Unicorn, a lovely 17th century village inn in the village offering accommodations with
modern comforts. We will gather for a welcome dinner at the hotel this evening.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><b>July 3, Monday: LOCAL TOURING.</b>&nbsp;<br>
 Today guests will be taken to two lovely gardens:<br>
- Barnsley House Gardens, Rosemary Verey's masterpiece. The garden was laid out in 1770 and re-planned in 1960. It features a knot garden and
gothic summerhouse which dates from 1770.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;- Hidcote Manor, Lawrence Johnson’s garden built in the early 1900’s. It
is 10 acres and is brilliantly divided by hedges into a series of separate “rooms” each one with a different theme.&nbsp;
We will return to the Unicorn for an evening at leisure and overnight.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><b>July 4, Tuesday: STOW ON THE WOLD/STOURHEAD/SHEPTON MALLET.</b>&nbsp;<br>
 Today guests travel south to Warminster and nearby Stourhead, one of the historically
supreme examples of English landscape design. Henry Hoare I, the banker son of the Lord Mayor of London, built Stourhead in the 1720s. His son,
Henry Hoare II, set about creating the lake, the Temple of Flora and The Grotto. In 1753 the Pantheon was built and in 1765 the Temple of Apollo
followed. It is the greatest surviving garden of its kind. NOTE: There is a great pub just at the entrance of the garden where guests can have
lunch on their own today. After touring the garden we travel the short distance to Shepton Mallet and Charlton House for overnight. This lovely
hotel is a former country house. Today it’s a family run hotel exquisitely furnished in the Mulberry Home Collection. It has an
excellent cuisine and a beautiful private garden. We include dinner here tonight.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><b>July 5, Wednesday: SHEPTON MALLET/BATTLE.</b> Today we will have an early
departure for an afternoon visit to Great Dixter, Christopher Lloyd’s garden. It’s 15th century half-timbered manor house is surrounded by yew
hedges, topiary and garden buildings. It is a delightful setting for his flower borders and rich diversity of plants. In the late afternoon we
travel to the small town of Battle and check into Powdermills Hotel, a Georgian country house hotel set in 150 acres of park-like grounds.&nbsp;
Dinner is included at the hotel tonight.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><b>July 6, Thursday: SISSINGHURST/LONDON.</b> This morning guests are taken to
either the small market town of Battle for free time and early lunch on their own. or we may arrange for a private garden visit. In the early
afternoon we will visit Sissinghurst Gardens, the late Vita Sackville-West and Sir Harold Nicolson masterpiece which features axial
walks connecting many gardens famous each with a different color scheme. The original house was destroyed by fire in 1948. The servants’ wing is
now the house and the ruins host a garden with herbs, climbers, a pool and a large
firtree. Sissinghurst features unique trees, shrubs, rhododendrons, roses and herbaceous plants. There will be a late
afternoon departure to London where the next two nights will be at Kingsway Hall. This is an elegant new traditionally styled hotel located
in fashionable Covent Garden and offers tastefully furnished bedrooms with the highest international standards. Evening will be at leisure
but guests may probably not arrive in London early enough to book theater tickets.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><b>July 7, Friday: HAMPTON COURT.</b> This morning guests will be met at their
hotel and transferred to Hampton Court to the Flower Show. We will include tickets for the show but not for return transfers. Guests will
return to Kingsway Hall in London on their own. The reminder of the day will be on your own.&nbsp;
July 8, Saturday: DEPART. The end of our services will be after breakfast. Guests will be on their own for transfer to the airport.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><b>NOTE:</b> When we know everyone’s schedule and find that several guests need
to be at the airport around the same time, we can arrange for a transfer and will give quotes based on specific numbers of people.</font></p>
